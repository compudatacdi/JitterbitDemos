testing with TestApexBook__c

-------------

created stuff so that when bring up a TestApexBook__c record:
	- will pull data from EC from a customer and append it to TestApexBook__c record with name "test6"
	- a button up top shows the value of the Name field of the current TestApexBook__c record

this is POC stuff to move on to making custom stuff for part inventory

files backed up here by manually creating files as need to work out the complexities of unit testing before use sf to do it
